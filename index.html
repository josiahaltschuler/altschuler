		<h3>University of Utah, Iwasa Lab | Project Quorum | <a target="_blank" href="http://projectquorum.org">projectquorum.org</a> | Angular, PHP (Slim) API, Sass</h3>
		Project Quorum is a flexible gaming platform which will crowdsource the analysis of visual data — such as microscopic images or graphical charts — that is provided directly by research scientists.

		<h3>BlueAlly | Web application to manage Verizon's VoIP networks | Angular, PHP (Slim) API, Sass</h3>
		A large-scale web application to manage all of Verizon's VoIP networks. The web application includes business rules for automatically generating Method of Procedures (MOPs) and configuration files, which can then be applied to infrastructure devices such as routers, firewalls and switches. It also validates data across multiple sites to eliminate data errors, such as conflicting information, invalid data and duplicate settings. The Verizon Portal provides additional benefits in that users can provision downstream systems, as well as audit production sites for differences between production and the Verizon Portal “database of record.” Customizable reports are available to allow users to query information from multiple sites for real-time analysis.
