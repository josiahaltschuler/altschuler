		<h2>What are salts and keys in WordPress?</h2>

		<p>Salts and keys are long strings of characters that are used in the encryption process for passwords. When you create a password, WordPress transforms it into an encrypted version of it using an encryption algorithm. This algorithm makes use of a salt or key in order to further encrypt it. The salts and keys are found in the wp-config.php file of WordPress. If someone were to get a hold of the salt or key, they might have a better chance of decrypting your password. In order to reduce the risk of this happening, it is recommended to change the salts and keys in your wp-config.php file once in a while. You can do this manually by editing the wp-config.php file directly or install a plugin, like Salt Shaker (<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/salt-shaker/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/salt-shaker/</a>), that does it automatically for you. You can schedule Salt Shaker to run periodically.</p>
